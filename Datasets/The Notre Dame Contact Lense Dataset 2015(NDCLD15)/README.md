**Description**
This database of 7300 images was constructed to evaluate contact lens detection under various experimental scenarios.  Images were acquired using either an IrisAccess LG4000 or an IrisGuard AD100 sensor; both sensors are equally represented. The dataset is composed of images from one of three equally-represented classes: No Lens, Soft Lens, and Textured Lens.
