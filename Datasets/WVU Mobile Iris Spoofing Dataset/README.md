**Description**<br/>
IIITD-WVU dataset of LivDet Iris 2017 competition has been designed as a cross-database evaluation where the sensors as well as the acquisition environments for the training and testing sets are different. It has the following two partitions:

1) Train: The training set of IIITD-WVU dataset is developed using 2,250 real and 1,000 textured contact lens iris images from IIIT-Delhi Contact Lens Iris (CLI) database which is captured in controlled settings. Also, 3,000 print attack images are selected from IIITD Iris Spoofing (IIS) database. It contains 4 folders: Contacts (containing textured contact lens iris images), Printouts (containing print attack images of live/real iris images), Contacts+Printouts (containing print attack images of contact lens iris images), and Live (containing live/real iris images).

2) Test: It is a novel multi-session iris presentation attack detection dataset comprising 4,209 iris images. The images in this dataset are captured using IriShield MK2120U mobile iris sensor at two different locations: indoors (controlled illumination) and outdoors (varying environmental situations). In the two sessions of data collection, iris images are acquired one at a time while wearing textured/patterned contact lens and without any lens (real). It contains 4 folders: Contacts (containing textured contact lens iris images), Printouts (containing print attack images of live/real iris images), Contacts+Printouts (containing print attack images of contact lens iris images), and Live (containing live/real iris images).
