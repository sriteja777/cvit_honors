**Description**<br/>
This dataset consists of 27 sessions of data with 676 unique subjects.  An average session contains 160 unique subjects which have multiple images from both the LG2200 and LG4000 iris sensors.  There are 29,986 images from the LG4000 and 116,564 images from the LG2200.  Every subject occurs in at least two sessions across the entire data set.  This data set spans three years, 2008 to 2010.  The initial images are taken from both sensors and are 640 by 480.  There are additional images included in this data set, known as the modified LG2200 images.  The original images have been stretched vertically by 5% to compensate for the non-unit aspect ratio of the digitizer used in the LG2200 computer-hosted runtime acquisition system (this elongation was suggested by Imad Malhas of IrisGuard inc.  in 2009).  Hence these additional images are of size 640 by 504.
