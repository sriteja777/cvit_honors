**Description**

This is a full set of iris images, with and without textured contact lenses, used in the LivDet-Iris 2017 competition (http://iris2017.livdet.org). It is built with samples taken from the Notre Dame Contact Lens Detection 2015 (NDCLD15). The training subset consists of 600 images of authentic irises (with no contacts, either soft or cosmetic) and 600 images of textured contact lenses manufactured by Ciba, UCL and ClearLab. The testing subset is split into "known spoofs" and "unknown spoofs‚Äù. The "known spoofs" dataset includes 900 images of textured contact lenses produced by Ciba, UCL and ClearLab (as in the training set) and 900 images of authentic irises. The unknown spoofs dataset includes 900 images of textured contact lenses produced by Cooper and J&J (i.e., not represented in the training set) and 900 images of authentic irises. All images were acquired using either an IrisAccess LG4000 or an IrisGuard AD100 sensor.
