I have read two Research Papers in this week

[Presentation Attack Detection for Cadaver Iris](../../Research\ Papers/1807.04058__2018.pdf)

Attackers use Iris from the dead to fool the system. In this paper, they built a model for detecting Iris presentation attacks from the dead people. It works with a good accuracy(98%) in distinguishing live and dead iris (atleast after 5 hrs of death). They used DCNN(Deep Convlolution Neural Networks) and VGG-16 architecture.

### Anti-spoofing: Iris Databases

This Paper works on some methods on how the databases for Iris Spoof Detection should be made so that the models can be trained without bias for wrong features. Also it lists some Iris datsets that are publicly available that can be used for research.
